# Thruster

Thruster is a game very much inspired by Jeremy Smith's 1986 classic C64 game Thrust, this time made for Arduboy.

The aim of the game is to find and collect the orb in each level, and to successfully leave the planet with it without you or the orb being destroyed.

Items:
* Enemies: Each level contains enemies that will shoot you if you get too close.
* Fuel: Thrusting uses fuel so make sure you have enough, fuel tanks can be found in each level.
* Power station: Shooting the power station will disable enemies temporarily, shoot it enough and it will go into meltdown and destroy the planet if you don't escape quickly (you will be awarded more points if the planet is critical when you escape).
* Orb: There is one orb in each level to collect and escape from the planet with.

Controls:
* A: Thrust
* B: Fire
* L: Rotate Left
* R: Rotate Right
* U: Pick up Orb/Fuel
* D: Drop Orb
